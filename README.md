# Tic-Tak-Toe(With Python)

Tic-Tac-Toe game with Python's Tkinter using Canvas 


This is the first python project I created without following a tutorial. I had seen tutorials for creating Tic-Tak-Toe using Python, but they all used buttons for the Tic-Tak-Toe boxes. I thought that coding it on Python's Tkinter Canvas would look a lot cooler and more clean, so I decided to abandon the tutorial and create the project myself. 
  
If you haven't used Python's Tkinter before and want to learn how, I would reccomend this tutorial. I found it simple and super easy to follow!

If you want to the Tic-Tak-Toe game using canvas, watch the above tutorial, then read through this link

These two should be enough to give you everything you need to create the project!
