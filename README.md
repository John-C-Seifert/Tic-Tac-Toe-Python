# Tik-Tak-Toe-Python-Canvas
This is the first python project I created without following a tutorial. I had seen tutorials for creating Tik-Tak-Toe using Python, but they all used buttons for the Tik-Tak-Toe boxes. I thought that coding it on Python's Tkinter Canvas would look a lot cooler and more clean, so I decided to abandon the tutorial and create the project by myself.
